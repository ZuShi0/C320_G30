## Instructions

- Simply run the main function in Abbreviations.java to run the program
- The main function will have numerous runs with increasing input sizes that will be fed to our algorithm so we can generate runtime data
- After the first 50001 lines have been translated, we write a file that contains the translated output (feel free to look through output.csv to verify the accuracy)
- After all runs are completed, we print the N and T values that will be pasted into our python notebook to plot runtime graphs

## Notes
- Make sure that the content.csv and processed_abbreviations.csv are both present in this folder
